## 🚀 Feature Description
Implement a real-time notification system that keeps users informed about important updates, announcements, deadlines, and system events.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Users currently have no way to receive timely updates about their courses, grades, assignments, or system announcements. This leads to missed deadlines and poor communication.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
Create a comprehensive notification system:

### Notification Types
- **Course Announcements**: Updates from lecturers
- **Grade Updates**: New grades posted
- **Assignment Deadlines**: Upcoming due dates
- **System Notifications**: Maintenance, updates, etc.
- **Personal Messages**: Direct communications

### Delivery Methods
- **In-app Notifications**: Real-time browser notifications
- **Email Notifications**: Digest emails for important updates
- **Push Notifications**: Mobile push (future enhancement)
- **SMS Notifications**: Critical alerts (optional)

### User Preferences
- Notification frequency settings
- Channel preferences (email, in-app, etc.)
- Category-based filtering
- Quiet hours configuration

## 🔄 Alternative Solutions
- Email-only notifications
- Simple in-app message system
- Third-party notification service integration

## 📊 Impact Assessment
- **User Impact**: High - Improves communication and engagement
- **Technical Impact**: Medium - Real-time features and email integration
- **Development Effort**: Medium - 2-3 weeks for implementation
