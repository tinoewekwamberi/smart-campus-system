## 🚀 Feature Description
Implement a comprehensive user profile management system that allows users to view, edit, and manage their personal information, preferences, and account settings.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Currently, users can only see basic information after login. There's no way to update profile information, change passwords, or manage account settings.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
Create a user profile management system with the following features:

### Profile Information
- Personal details (name, email, phone, address)
- Profile picture upload
- Academic information (student ID, department, etc.)
- Contact preferences
- Privacy settings

### Account Management
- Password change functionality
- Email verification
- Account deactivation
- Two-factor authentication (optional)

### Role-Specific Features
- **Students**: Academic history, study plans, grade history
- **Lecturers**: Teaching history, office hours, research interests
- **Staff**: Administrative roles, department assignments

## 🔄 Alternative Solutions
- Basic profile editing only
- Separate profile and settings pages
- Third-party profile management integration

## 📊 Impact Assessment
- **User Impact**: High - Users need to manage their information
- **Technical Impact**: Medium - File uploads and form handling
- **Development Effort**: Medium - 1-2 weeks for implementation

## 🎨 Mockups/Designs
- Profile page with editable sections
- Settings page with account options
- Profile picture upload interface
- Responsive design for mobile

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can view and edit their profile information
- [ ] Profile picture upload and management works
- [ ] Password change functionality is secure
- [ ] Role-specific information is displayed
- [ ] Form validation and error handling
- [ ] Responsive design for all devices
