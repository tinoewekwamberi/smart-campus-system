## 🚀 Feature Description
Implement a comprehensive grade tracking and management system that allows lecturers to input grades, students to view their academic progress, and staff to oversee grade management.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
There's no systematic way to track and manage student grades. Lecturers need to input grades, students need to view their progress, and the system needs to calculate GPAs and academic standing.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
Create a complete grade management system:

### Backend Models
```python
class Assignment(models.Model):
    course = models.ForeignKey(Course, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    description = models.TextField()
    due_date = models.DateTimeField()
    total_points = models.DecimalField(max_digits=5, decimal_places=2)
    weight = models.DecimalField(max_digits=3, decimal_places=2)  # Percentage of final grade

class Grade(models.Model):
    student = models.ForeignKey(CustomUser, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    assignment = models.ForeignKey(Assignment, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    score = models.DecimalField(max_digits=5, decimal_places=2)
    letter_grade = models.CharField(max_length=2)
    feedback = models.TextField(blank=True)
    submitted_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    graded_by = models.ForeignKey(CustomUser, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='grades_given')
    graded_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
```

### Grade Calculation
- Automatic GPA calculation
- Letter grade conversion
- Course grade aggregation
- Academic standing assessment

### Role-Based Access
- **Students**: View own grades and GPA
- **Lecturers**: Input grades for their courses
- **Staff**: View all grades and generate reports

## 🔄 Alternative Solutions
- Simple grade input without calculations
- External grade management system integration
- Manual grade tracking in spreadsheets

## 📊 Impact Assessment
- **User Impact**: High - Core academic functionality
- **Technical Impact**: Medium - Complex calculations and data management
- **Development Effort**: Medium - 2-3 weeks for implementation

## 🎨 Mockups/Designs
- Grade input interface for lecturers
- Grade viewing dashboard for students
- Grade reports and analytics
- GPA calculation display

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Lecturers can input grades for assignments
- [ ] Students can view their grades and GPA
- [ ] Automatic grade calculations work correctly
- [ ] Grade history is maintained
- [ ] Role-based access controls work
- [ ] Grade reports can be generated

## 🔗 Related Issues
- Issue #003: Course management (required for grade tracking)
- Issue #002: Role-based navigation (needed for grade interfaces)

## 📝 Additional Context
This is a critical academic feature that requires careful attention to data accuracy and security. Should be implemented after course management is complete.
