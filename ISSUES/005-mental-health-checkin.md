## 🚀 Feature Description
Implement a mental health check-in system that allows students to track their wellness, provides anonymous crisis reporting, and connects students with counseling resources.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Student mental health is a critical concern in higher education. There's no systematic way to track student wellness or provide timely support when needed.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
Create a comprehensive mental health support system:

- Stress level assessment

### Anonymous Crisis Reporting

- Resource recommendations

### Wellness Dashboard

### Counselor Integration
