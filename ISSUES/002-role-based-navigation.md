## 🚀 Feature Description
Implement role-specific navigation menus and dashboard layouts for different user roles (Student, Lecturer, Staff). Each role should see different navigation options and dashboard content relevant to their responsibilities.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Currently, all users see the same navigation and dashboard regardless of their role. This creates confusion and doesn't provide role-specific functionality that users need.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
Create role-based navigation components and dashboard layouts that display different content based on the user's role:

### Student Dashboard
- Course enrollment status
- Current grades and GPA
- Upcoming assignments
- Study plan progress
- Mental health check-in reminders

### Lecturer Dashboard
- Courses being taught
- Student roster for each course
- Grade submission interface
- Course announcements
- Office hours scheduling

### Staff Dashboard
- User management interface
- System statistics
- Support ticket management
- Course management tools
- Administrative reports

## 🔄 Alternative Solutions
- Single dashboard with role-based sections
- Tabbed interface with role-specific tabs
- Modal-based role switching

## 📊 Impact Assessment
- **User Impact**: High - Users will have better experience with role-relevant information
- **Technical Impact**: Medium - Requires React Router and conditional rendering
- **Development Effort**: Medium - 1-2 weeks for implementation

## 🎨 Mockups/Designs
- Navigation sidebar with role-specific menu items
- Dashboard cards showing relevant information
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Navigation menu changes based on user role
- [ ] Dashboard displays role-specific information
- [ ] Responsive design works on all devices
- [ ] Smooth transitions between different views
- [ ] Role information is properly fetched from backend
